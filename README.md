Bash script for Graph Generation using GnuPlot and Apache-Benchmark
===================================================================


This piece of code is basically for generating graph using gnuplot with the data output from apache benchmark tool for HTTP. 
It plots response time vs requests graph for HTTP connection. This was made because i wanted to explore how status.github.com is generating graphs.
